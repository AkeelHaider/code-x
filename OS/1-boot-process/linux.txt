LINUX BOOT PROCESS
-------------------

STEPS
--------
BIOS --> MBR --> GRUB --> KERNEL --> INIT --> RUNLEVEL

1. BIOS
--------
* Full form => Basic Input Output System.
* Checks integrity of the system before booting.
* Looks for the bootable disks, amd load it to the memeory.
* The control now transfers to MBR.

2. MBR
-------
* Full Form => Master Boot Record
* MBR is located in the first sector of the bootable drive.
* MBR is less that 1/2 KB. It contains 3 parts:
	1. Primary Boot
	2. Partition Table 
	3. MBR Validation
* It contains information about GRUB. 
* It loads the GRUB and give control to it.

3. GRUB
--------
* Full Form => Grand Unified BootLoader
* It displays Splash Screen, if not interrupted it loads kernel.
* GRUB configuration file is present in /etc/grub/grub.config
* GRUB loads the kernel in 3 stages:
	Stage 1. Stages the loading process of the complex Operating System.
	Stage 1.5. Present in space 30 KB after MBR. Simluate a /boot partition for booting.
	Stage 2. Loads the kernel, whose information is present at /etc/grub/grub.conf.

4. KERNEL
----------
* It is responsible for the working of Operating System.
* Mount ROOT file system, present as "root=" in grub.conf
* Execute /sbin/init
* Pid for kernel is 1
* intrd (Inital Ram Disk), is used as temporary root file system.
* It helps kernel to recognize the devices and disks connected to system.
* Stage of Loading Kernel:
	1. Configures H/W and Allocates Memory.
	2. Uncompress initrd image and mounts as root file system.
	3. Looks for the Hard Drives.
	4. Unmounts initrd.
	5. Mount the /root partition.
	6. Run init process. 

5. INIT
--------
* Looks at /etc/inittab and decide Linux Run Level
* Run Levels:
	0 - Hault
	1 - Single User Mode
	2 - Multiuser Mode, no NFS (Network File Server)
	3 - Full Multiuser Mode
	4 - Unused
	5 - X11 (GUI)
	6 - Reboot
* Default Run Level - 3 or 5

6. RUN LEVEL PROGRAMS
----------------------
* Set of services are started during bootup.
* Programs located at /etc/rc.d/rc<run lvl>.d is executed depending on the run level.
* Programs starts with S are used during startup.
* Programs starts with K are used during kill.
* Numbers after K and S is the sequence in which each program is executed.
