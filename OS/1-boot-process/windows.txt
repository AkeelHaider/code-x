WINDOWS BOOT PROCESS
--------------------

STEPS
-----
BIOS(POST -> MBR) --> Boot Loader --> Boot Files --> Kernel --> Services

1. BIOS
--------
A. POST
    * Full Form => Power On Self Test
    * Checks all the hardware devices like RAM, HDD.
B. MBR
    * Same as for Linux

2. BOOT LOADER
---------------
A. STAGE 1
    * Prepares of Loading of Boot Files
B. STAGE 2
    * Loads up Boot Files to memory.

3. BOOT FILES
--------------
A. NTDLR
    * Full Form => NT Loader
    * Path => C:/Windows/i386/NTDLR
B. boot.ini
    * Contains configuration file from NTDLR
    * While loading kernel in windows, we can't pass arguments, hence boot.ini is used.
C. NTDETECT.COM
    * Detects H/W and passes it to NTDLR.
    * Generate a new HW key for each HW during startup.
    * HW key is used to indentify each element.

4. KERNEL
----------
* Kernal Path => C:/Windows/System32/ntoskrnal.exe
* HAL (HW Abstraction Layer) library files help kernal to interact with HW.
* Drivers are loader from C:/Windows/System32/config/System32
* Kernel is loader to primary memory

5. Services
------------
* A set od services is started as windows laods.
* Last service to be loaded is winlogon.exe
* It calls the masgina.dll library (Microsoft Graphics Indetification and Authentication Authority)
* MASGINA verifies the username and password.
