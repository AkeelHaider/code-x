FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPILATION
----------------------------

4 Stages of Compilation
    1. PreProcessing
    2. Compilation
    3. Assembly
    4. Linking


STEPS
------
1. Write a Hello World C Program.
2. Save the file as hello.c 
3. Give Command: gcc -Wall --save-temps hello.c -o hello 
4. This will generate 4 files
    hello hello.i hello.s hello.o

1. PRE PROCESSING
------------------
* Command: gcc -Wall -E hello.c
* File: hello.i 
* Replaces the Macro from all the places.
* Comments are removed
* Includes dircetives are replaced with orignal code

2. COMPILING
---------------
* File: hello.s
* Converts the source file to assembly code.

3. ASSEMBLY
-------------
* File: hello.of
* Assembly file is taken and converted to obejct code.
* At this stage the function calls such as printf() is not resolved.

4. LINKING
------------
* File: hello
* The defination of function calls like printf() is resolved.
* Adds extra code to the source code, which helps in starting and finishing of the program.
